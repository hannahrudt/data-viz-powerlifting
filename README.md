# data-viz-powerlifting
Personal project visualizing female athlete powerlifting progress.

## Project Description:
### This personal project visualizes female powerlifting progress between 1985 and 1995 in benchpress and squat events. 

## Strengths:
- Data descriptions show my ability to familiarize myself with with raw and clean data, as well as understand the cleaning process.

- Scatter plots in Summary Statistics are important to communicating context to viewers, which is one of my interests and strengths.

- Introduction and Interpretation and Conclusions are examles of mastery of data analysis. These sections exemplify that I can communicate the meaning of complicated technical analyses performed by teammates. 

## Repository organization:

- The main __[HTML](/index.html)__ contains the visualization. 

- The cleaned data is in the [powerlifting](/powerlifting.csv) CSV file.
